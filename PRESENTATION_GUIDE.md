## 🔧 **How to Use for Presentations**

### **Step 1: Start the Application**
```powershell
# Frontend (Terminal 1)
cd E:\Project-x_Full_Stack
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:3002

# Backend (Terminal 2)
cd E:\Project-x_Full_Stack\backend
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### **Step 2: Upload Test Data**
1. Go to http://localhost:3002
2. Click "Upload Data" tab
3. Upload `large_transactions.csv`
4. Set parameters:
   - Min Support: 0.03 (3%)
   - Min Confidence: 0.5 (50%)
   - Algorithm: Apriori

### **Step 3: Explore Visualizations**
1. Navigate to "Visualizations" tab
2. Click through each visualization type
3. Observe the different insights provided
4. Use tooltips and interactive features

### **Step 4: Dashboard Analysis**
1. Check "Dashboard" tab for data tables
2. Review frequent itemsets and association rules
3. Examine quality metrics and performance stats

## 📊 **Key Metrics Explained**

### **Support**
- Frequency of itemset in transactions
- Higher = more common pattern
- Threshold: Usually 1-5%

### **Confidence**
- Reliability of the rule (A → B)
- Higher = more predictable
- Threshold: Usually 50-80%

### **Lift**
- Association strength vs independence
- >1 = positive association
- >2 = strong association

### **Conviction**
- How much more likely consequent occurs with antecedent
- Higher = stronger implication

## 🎯 **Presentation Tips**

### **For Technical Audiences:**
- Start with Support vs Lift scatter
- Explain quality metrics using radar chart
- Show algorithm performance differences

### **For Business Audiences:**
- Begin with item frequency (most popular products)
- Use antecedent/consequent distributions for recommendations
- Focus on high-confidence, high-lift rules

### **For Academic Presentations:**
- Demonstrate all visualization types
- Compare algorithm performance
- Discuss parameter sensitivity using different thresholds

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **No Rules Found:**
- Lower min_support (try 0.01-0.02)
- Lower min_confidence (try 0.3-0.4)
- Check data format and quality

### **Too Many Rules:**
- Increase min_support (try 0.05-0.1)
- Increase min_confidence (try 0.7-0.8)
- Filter by lift > 1.5
