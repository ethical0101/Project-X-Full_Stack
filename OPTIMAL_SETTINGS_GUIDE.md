**3-Itemsets (Triples):** ~8-15 combinations
- {milk, bread, butter}, {milk, bread, cheese}
- {coffee, sugar, cream}
- {laptop, mouse, keyboard}
- {shirt, pants, shoes}
- {car, gas, oil}

#### **Association Rules (40-100 total):**

**Strong Rules (80%+ confidence):**
- coffee → sugar (very high confidence)
- sugar → coffee (very high confidence)
- laptop → mouse (high confidence)
- mouse → laptop (high confidence)

**Medium Rules (60-80% confidence):**
- milk → bread, bread → butter
- shirt → pants, pants → shoes
- car → gas, gas → oil

**Exploratory Rules (50-60% confidence):**
- cheese → wine, wine → crackers
- phone → charger, tablet → charger

## 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE SETTINGS BY PURPOSE**

### **🎯 Conservative (Only Strong Patterns)**
```
Support: 0.05 (5%)
Confidence: 0.7 (70%)
```
**Results:** 20-30 itemsets, 15-25 very reliable rules

### **🔍 Exhaustive (Every Possible Pattern)**
```
Support: 0.02 (2%)
Confidence: 0.4 (40%)
```
**Results:** 100+ itemsets, 150+ rules (may be overwhelming)

### **⚡ Quick Analysis (Fast Results)**
```
Support: 0.08 (8%)
Confidence: 0.6 (60%)
```
**Results:** 15-25 itemsets, 10-20 strong rules

## 🕸️ **CONCEPT LATTICE SETTINGS**

For the same dataset in Concept Lattice analysis:
- **File**: Use same `comprehensive_dataset.csv`
- **Expected Concepts**: 15-25 formal concepts
- **Lattice Structure**: Clear hierarchy with food, electronics, clothing clusters
- **Processing Time**: 2-5 seconds

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Frequent Pattern Mining**
1. **Open Data Upload tab** (📁)
2. **Configure settings**:
   ```
   Minimum Support: 0.03
   Minimum Confidence: 0.5
   Algorithm: Apriori
   ```
3. **Upload**: `comprehensive_dataset.csv`
4. **Click**: "Mine Patterns"

### **Phase 2: Explore Results**
1. **Dashboard**: Overview of 50-80 itemsets, 40-100 rules
2. **Analytics**: Performance metrics, quality measures
3. **Visualizations**: 12 different charts showing patterns

### **Phase 3: Concept Lattice**
1. **Go to Concept Lattice tab** (🕸️)
2. **Upload same file**: `comprehensive_dataset.csv`
3. **Explore**: Interactive concept hierarchy

## 🎯 **GUARANTEED RICH RESULTS**

**You WILL get:**
✅ **50+ frequent itemsets** across all categories
✅ **40+ association rules** with varying confidence levels
✅ **Clear category patterns** (food, electronics, clothing)
✅ **Multi-level relationships** (1, 2, 3-item combinations)
✅ **Interactive visualizations** showing all pattern types
✅ **Complete concept lattice** with meaningful hierarchy

**This dataset + these settings = Complete, rich analysis with all pattern types!**

## 🎯 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**If too few results (< 20 itemsets):**
- Lower support to 0.025 or 0.02

**If too many results (> 150 itemsets):**
- Raise support to 0.04 or 0.05

**If processing is slow:**
- Raise support to 0.05
- Use FP-Growth algorithm instead

**If rules are unreliable:**
- Raise confidence to 0.6 or 0.7

**Perfect balance: Support=0.03, Confidence=0.5 with this comprehensive dataset!**
